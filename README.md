## Introduction

This repository is a collection of tasks related to computer vision using OpenCV at Damascus University. It serves as a resource for students and enthusiasts interested in exploring computer vision concepts and applications.


## Tasks

List of tasks and projects included in this repository:

1. Task 1: In this task, we explore the fundamental concept of feature extraction in the context of computer vision using OpenCV. Feature extraction plays a crucial role in image analysis, enabling the identification and representation of distinctive patterns or characteristics within an image.

2. Task 2: In Task 2, we delve into the application of morphological operations in the realm of computer vision using OpenCV. Morphological operations are essential image processing techniques that deal with the structure and shape of objects within an image.

3. Task 3: Task 3 explores advanced image processing techniques, focusing on detecting line edges and removing text from images using OpenCV. These operations are crucial for various computer vision applications, including image enhancement and object recognition.

3. Task 4: Task 4 explores the fascinating realm of features detection and matching in computer vision, employing the powerful OpenCV library. These techniques are fundamental in various applications such as image stitching, object recognition, and 3D reconstruction.
